ML2 - Machine Learning Project
ðŸ“Œ Overview
ML2 is a machine learning project designed to [briefly describe the goal, e.g., "classify images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)"]. The project focuses on building, training, and evaluating machine learning models with a robust and scalable pipeline.

ðŸš€ Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Model training and evaluation
Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization
Visualization of model performance (e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy plots)
